Step 1:Take each number from the array and subtract it from the target
Step 2: If the answer is present in the hash map we got the output 
            else
              append that number in the hash map eg.[2:0] here 2 is the number and 0 is the index of the number
Step 3: continue step 2 till we get the output 
Step 4: End
